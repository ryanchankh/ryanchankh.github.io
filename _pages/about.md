I am a fifth-year Electrical and Systems Engineering PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by Prof. René Vidal. I was supported by Penn Engineering Dean’s Fellowship and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (NSFGRFP). I received my BA in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley and was advised by Prof. Yi Ma. I was an AI/ML Intern at Apple's Health AI team in Seattle for Summer 2024. Before starting my PhD, I was a machine learning researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. 

My research interests center on the development of trustworthy machine learning systems. From small-scale medical problems to large-scale multi-modal challenges, the goal is to not only understand modern deep learning on both theoretical and practical fronts, but also ensure they are implementable, accessible, and intuitive to those who rely on such systems. To achieve this, I build frameworks and algorithms that impose well-structured assumptions about the data, make use of interpretable features, and generate human-aligned explanations. 

Feel free to contact me for potential collaborations and discussions.
